This outline provides a solid starting point. As you move through development, you will need to flesh out the functional requirements (Section 6) with much more detail, potentially creating separate requirement documents or user stories for each specific screen or workflow. The user stories (Section 5) help ensure the requirements are tied back to actual user needs. Remember to revisit and update this PRD as your project evolves.

Instructions for the User:

Start with Command 1. Give it to the AI.

Then, give Command 2 to the AI.

Continue giving the commands sequentially (Command 3, Command 4, etc.) to the AI.

When you reach Commands 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, make sure to copy and paste the content (the lists of user stories or requirements) from the original PRD into the command where indicated by the parenthetical notes (Include the ... here).

Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders like [Insert Date] and [Your Name(s)] in Command 1.

The AI should build the PRD section by section as you provide the commands.
